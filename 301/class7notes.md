# [Class 7 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/301/class7notes.md)

This topic matters because it dives into APIs and HTTP.

## How I explained REST to my brother

Roy Fielding wrote the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. Then did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

The techniques that we use today won't work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world because it was not designed to be used like that right now.

HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friend created was HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) uses verbs and nouns to get data from the server.

GET is used to requesting the data.

POST is used to add something to another system.

PUT is used when a system wants to replace something in another system

PATCH is used to do partial update.
