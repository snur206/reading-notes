# [Class 4 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class4notes.md)

This topic matters to what I am studying because it is a continuation of learning about the html, css, and js languages as I go onto becoming a developer.

## HTML

To create a basic link, you wrap text or other content inside < a > element.

href contains the web address.

Some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers:

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.

- Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.

- Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

## CSS Layout

Normal flow is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

Differences between block-level and inline elements is that block-level elememt appears on a new line and inline elements never appear on new lines.  

Static positioning is the default for every html element.

A few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element:

- It sits on its own layer separate from everything else and no longer exists in the normal document flow.

- 

The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that "absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport"
