New terms that I feel should be highlighted/definition list:

FILO(First In Last Out):  first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

LIFO(Last In First Out): Opposite of FILO, last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

Push O(1): Pushing a node onto a stack is O(1) because it is taking the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes that is had in the stack.

Pop O(1): Removing a node from the top.

FIFO(First In First Out): First item in the queue is the first item out of the queue.

LILO(Last In Last Out): Opposite of FIFO, last item in the queue is the last item out of the queue.

Enqueue O(1): Use this action when you are adding an item to the queue using O(1) operation because it is taking the same amount of time to perform the operation, no matter how many items live in the queue.

Dequeue O(1): Use this action when you are removing an item to the queue using O(1) operation because you are always removing the front of the node in the queue, no matter how many items live in the queue.
