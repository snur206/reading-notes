# [Class 2 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class2notes.md)

This topic matters because it dives into loops and arrays in Java.

## Questions

Which loops use a loop counter?

For Loop.

Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.

- public static boolean equals(long[] a, long[] a2) - Returns true if the two specified arrays of longs are equal to one another. 

- public static void sort(Object[] a) - Sorts an specified array of objects into ascending order.

- public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object key) - Searches the specified array of Object.

Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.
