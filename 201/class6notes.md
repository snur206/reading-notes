# [Class 6 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class6notes.md)

This topic matters because we are learning what DOM is and it's relations to JS & HTML and objects and what that is which is new things for us to learn.

## JavaScript Object Basics

I would explain an object to a non-technical person saying that it is a collection of data/functions where you start defining and initializing a variable(can be numbers and text like names).

Some advantages to creating object literals is that you can transfer a series of structured or related data items and if you create more than one object literal, your current object "enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create."

Objects differ to arrays because you are using names that are associated with the members value instead of (index) numbers.

You use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of instead of dot notation because when a object property name is held in a variable,  you cannot use dot notation to access the value, but you can when you are using bracket notation.

***this*** is refering to the current object the code is being written inside. The advantage is that when creating more than one of it, *this* enables you to use the same definiton for all object that you created.

## Introduction To The DOM

DOM is a programming interface for web documents where the program can change the structure, style, and content of the document.

The relationship between the DOM and JS is that without DOM (not a programming language) JS wouldn't have any model or notion of webpages and DOM is what allows JS to interact with the HTML
