Version Control 
Is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or a set of files by recording the changes.

Centralized Version Control
The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or a set of files where it would lead to the arrival of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
System entails a single server storing all of the changes and file versions that can bee found/accessed by various clients 
Allows programmers to gain more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files and gives administrators a lot more control over divvying up revision privileges.
Distributed Version Control (DVCS):
Addresses the major vulnerabilities from CVS: server as a single point of failure.
If CVS goes down, collaborators will cannot work with one another on a file, save changes and new versions.
All work will be lost, except any portions on local machines in the event of corruption of the central database’s hard disk if it has no backups.
DVCS allows multiple mirrored repos where programmers that are working in teams can collaborate with each other in different ways to finish a team project. That enables the use of various workflows be done at the same time.
GIT?
Snapshots:
Git is a DVCS that stores date in a system made of snapshots. Every time you save a changed version of your project (commit) Git will create a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the fi, Git
