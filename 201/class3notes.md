## **HTML**

You would use an *unordered list* in a HTML document when you want to group things that are not in numeric order and the order is meaningless.

*Bullet style* is not defined in HTML but in CSS you use the property *list-style-type*.

You use an *ordered list* in a HTML document when you want the order to be meaingful, unlike with an *unordered list*.

## **CSS**

*Margin* is 

Four parts of an HTML elements box are:

- *Content box*: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

- *Padding box*: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

- *Border box*: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

- *Margin box*: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## **JS**

The data types you store in an array are strings, numbers, and objects.

People is not a valid JS array because it is a declared variable and what is in the brackets and single quote marks are the defined arrays or items.

Five shorthand operators:

- Assignment x = f(): assigns a value to a variable.

- Addition assignment x += f(): adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. 

- Subtraction assignment x -= f(): subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

- Multiplication assignment x * = f(): multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

- Division assignment x /= f(): divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

A real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program is when humans are making decisions like "should I eat one cookie or two?". 

function greetUser(){

    let usersName = prompt ("What is your name?");
    // if(usersName == ""){
    //   usersName = prompt ("What is your name again?");
    // }
    // while (usersName == ""){
    //    usersName = prompt("What was your name???")


## Things I want to know more about

The box model and loops is are things that caught my attention because it looks fimiliar to want I learned in 102.
