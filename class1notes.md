My notes about **Markdown**.

Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document.

* To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header). 
* Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document.
* quote text with a >.
* To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. For example, **This is bold text**
* To italicize, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. For example,  *This text is italicized*
* For bold and italicize text, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. For example, ***All this text is important***
