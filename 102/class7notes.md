**Programming with JS**

***Control Flow***

Is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures (extremely frequent) that change the control flow, like conditionals and loops.

Script submits validated data and the user leaves a required field empty, script will prompt you to fill it in.

Script will use a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not.

Typicaal script in JS include many control structures, includung conditionals, loops and functions. Part(s) of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

**JS Functions**

JS Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

JS Function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

JS function is defined with the function keyword, then by a name, followed by ()

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Same rules as variables.

() may include parameter names separated by commas. EX: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)

Code is executed, by the function, is placed inside {}

Function ***parameters*** are listed inside () in the function definition.

Function ***arguments*** are the ***values*** received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

**Function Invocation**

The code inside the function will execute when "something" *invokes* (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

- Automatically (self invoked)

**Function Return**

When JS reaches a *return* statement, the function will stop ececuting.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JS will *return* to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a *return value*. Return value is "returned" back to the "caller"

**Why Fucntions?**

Can reuse code, define the code once and can use it more

Can use the same code many times with different aruments to produce different results.
