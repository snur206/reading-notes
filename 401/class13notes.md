This topic matters because it is a continuation of Spring, but regarding relationship in Spring Data REST and testing. 

## Related data in Spring (only read section “3. One-to-Many Relationship”)

It is a tutorial on the relationships between entities in Spring Data REST. 

Relationships: 

- The Data Model: Library and Address are two entity classes that have one-to-one relationship by using the @OneToOne annotation.

- One-to-Many Relationship: Use @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations to define the one to many relationship, also can add the optional @RestResource annotation to customize the association.

- Many-to-Many Relationship: Use @ManyToMany annotation, to which we can also add @RestResource to define many-to-many relationship.
