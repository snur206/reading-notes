# [Class 7 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class7notes.md)

This topic matters because we are going to learn more about  the language and elements to code.

## Domain Modeling

We need Domain modeling because it defines vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams where it is a communication tool.


## HTML Table Basics

Tables should not be used for layouts because it reduces accessibility for users who are visually impaired.

Three different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table:
  
  - < th > : Table header denotes a header. Easier to find data when a header stands out and the design would look better. It defines a cell as header of a group of table cells.
  
  - < tr > : defines a row of cells in a table
  
  - < thead > : defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table.

## Introducing Constructors

Constructor is a function that is called using the new keyword. Some advantages is that it binds this. to the new object where refer to this in your constructor code and it automatically initializes the object(s) when they are declared.

The term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor because in a object literal this. is only refering to a call from this. object and in a constructor this. is referring to a call from another constructor.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Prototypes and Inheritance: Worked at one my Dads mini market before and for example it can be a fall back option when he is retired and I take over it as the owner. Hierarchy is between him, his brother, me, and his workers. In that order.
