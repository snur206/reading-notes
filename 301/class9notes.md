# [Class 9 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/301/class9notes.md)

This topic matters because it is diving into a new topic, functional programming and modules & require().

## Functional Programming Concepts

Functional programming is a programming paradigm. A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects and that is how we know if it is a pure function.

Immuntability means it is unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

Referential transparency means if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
