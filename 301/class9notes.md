# [Class 9 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/301/class9notes.md)

This topic matters because it is diving into a new topic, functional programming and modules & require().

## Functional Programming Concepts

Functional programming is a programming paradigm. A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects and that is how we know if it is a pure function.

The benefits of a pure function is that it does not cause any observable side effects.

Immuntability means it is unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

Referential transparency means if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.


## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

Module is another Javascript file.

The word ‘require’ takes functionalities from one file and places it in another file. In that other file you make a global function and say require('./filename'). 

We bring another module into the file the we are working in by using module.export = to what ever you want to be available outside of that module. 

To make a module available you set require to equal to a variable because it will return whatever is on the module.exports property.

## Things I want to know more about

modules and how we will use it in class.
