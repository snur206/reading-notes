This topic matters because it is introducing the topucs of nosql and sql.

## nosql vs sql

Five differences between nosql and sql:

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases and NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
 	  
- SQL databases are table based databases and NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

- SQL databases have predefined schema and NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable and the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

- SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

Complex query intensive environment data is a good fit for an SQL database.
