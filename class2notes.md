# Class 2 reading notes

Text editor is a software that you install/download that will let you write/text as you build your webpage. Examples of some of the software tools used are Microsoft Word, Google Docs, NotePad and Apple Pages. This is used to edit text. Some features that is looked for is code completion,  syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes (so it would reduce eye strain and fatigue) and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. Code editors is alternatively where you would write codes. Some examples are Github Atom, Microsoft's, vs. Code Visual studio, Notepad++ and Vim. Integrated Development Environment is a software that everything comes together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. The comparison between text editors, coding specific editor and IDEs  is that they all involve text.

Basic Commands:

Print working directory: ~pwd ells you what your current or present working directory is. Where are we currently

Runs by itself with no arguments

Cd: change directory/move to another directory

Ls: list the contents of a directory, a little more powerful

Mkdir: make directory

Touch: create new file

Cd space .. takes back one space

# of Dots takes back directory

Hit tab to auto complete 

[]- items are optional, may run the command w/ or w/o them

Normal file ( - ) Directory ( d )

( /etc )- tells ls not to list current directory  but list the directories contents




Command line will give you a prompt that will be displayed

( user@bash ) is a prompt presented and after you would enter command (ls )

Command is first thing you would type.

After that, enter  ( -l /home/ryan )

Enter spaces to separate  (MUST use between command and first command line argument)

( -l ) is option: modify behavior of command

List options before other arguments that would start with ( - )

Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. 

After the command has run and the terminal is ready for you to enter another command the prompt will be displayed. If no prompt is displayed then the command may still be running (you will learn later how to deal with this).

Terminal won’t have numbers most likely

Open Terminal Applications -> Utilities or search in the ,magnify glass 

Shell is part of the operating system that defines how the terminal behaves/;pols after running the commands 

Most common is called bash, stands for Bourne again shell

Command named echo that displays a system variable stating current shell

Echo command is used to display messages

As long as it prints something to the screen that ends in bash then all is good.

Path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

Absolute and relative is types of paths we can use

When refering to a file or directory we are using one of these paths.
