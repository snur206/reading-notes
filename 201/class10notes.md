Key differences between *Syntax Errors* and *Logic Errors* is that syntax errors are spelling errors in code that causes the program not to run, or stop working part way through and most likely provides a error message, while with logic errors, the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results and there isn't an error message that would point you to the error.

In the previous lab, some errors I seen were indenting and not seeing my footer function. With indenting I just hovered over the error and selected quick fix to indent all of the codes that needed to be indented.
