This topic matters because as I go on my journey to understand the different languages it helps to go over the basics to study to fully grasp it.

## Things I want to know more about

 What are screen readers and how are they used? Hours/homework same as format as 102? 

**Getting Started** 

Messages, computer to computer how do you get data sent? Browsers will send a request message to the server about a copy of the website to you, HTTP finds the address so your head does not have a dent. That message, what a message, will go across internet connection by use of TCP-IP. You see. Once the server approves of your request, you will get a mulitple approval message as you go onto your quest. Website files get sent out in small chunks that gets turned into a whole webpage better known as data packets. This is the end, its getting cold here so I'm gonna put on a jacket.

HTML file is parsed first from the browser, where the <link> element is recogized. Referencing to external CSS stylesheets as well as <script>.
  
Once that is done, a request is sent back to the server that any CSS files that has the <link> elements. Javascript files is found from <script> and from that it parses the CSS and JS.
  
You can find an image(s) to add to your website by finding an image you want from a website (most likely Google Images) and click it to get a larger look at it. You then right click said image, then click save image as to save/store it in your computer. You can also copy the web address of that image from your browser's address bar for later.
  
In JS, to create a string you would put it inbetween single quote marks and to create a number you don't or any quotation marks.
  
A variable in Javascript is something that holds value which is why it is important in Javascript. A variable can be named anything to an extent.
  
**Introduction to HTML**
  
An HTML atribute is something that has extra info ahout the element that will not show in the content. It must have space between it and the name of the element. The attribute name is followed by an equal sign, then the attribute value with opening and closing quote marks.
  
<article> is a block of content that can be on its own/independent as supposed to <section> where it more of a grouping of things. 
  
A "typical" website uses a header, navigation bar, main content, sidebar, and footer elements.
  
Metadata influences Search Engine Optimization because it will make your page more visable and higher on a search engine. 
  
<meta> HTML tag is used for data describing data and in HTML the way to add metadata to a document you use the <meta> element.
  
**Miscellaneous**
  
The first step into designing a website is to question yourself in terms of what you want to accomplish, what are your goals and what do you do to get it done. Worry about that first before the technical side (project ideation).  
  
  
The most important question to answer when designing a website is what exactly do you want to accomplish?  
  
**Semantics**  
  
You use an <h1> over a <span> to display a top level heading because <h1> is a semantic element in HTML and <span> will make it look like a top level heading but it doesn't have no semantic value. 
  
The benefits of using semantic tag in HTML:
  
- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (Search Engine Optimization). 
  
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
  
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.
  
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated 
  
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
  
**What is Javascript**
  
The two things that require JS in the browser are a browser API that is built into your web browser and is able to expose data from the "surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things." and Third party APIs "are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web."
  
You add JS to an HTML document you use the <script> element.
