This topic matters because it is introducting node.js and the reasons for pair programming.

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Stack Overflow explains it as an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine is as open source javascript engine that runs on multiple chromium-based web browsers (Google Chrome) that is responisble for putting together  JavaScript directly to local machine code that your computer can execute.

Node is a JavaScript runtime means Node.js can execute Javascript.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

6 reasons for pair programming:

- Greater efficiency

- Engaged collaboration

- Learning from fellow students

- Social skills

- Job interview readiness

- Work environment readiness

In my experience, learning from fellow students is what I found most beneficial, learning different techniques and ideas.

Pair programming works by having two roles, the driver and the navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose is writing the code. The Navigator uses their words to help guide the driver but does not do any of the typing of the code. They also scan typos and bugs.
