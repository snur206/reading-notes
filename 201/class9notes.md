# [Class 9 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class9notes.md)

This topic matters because these are new methods and elements in HTML and JS that I am learning.

## HTML Forms

Forms matter in web development because they are used to collect data from users or allowing them to control the user interface. 

Some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience is that the bigger that your form is, you are running the risk if frustrating people and losing users. Just keep things simple, stay focused, and ask only for the data you absolutely need.

5 form elements:

-  < fieldset >: A way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic reasons/purpose.

- < legend >: A caption for its content parent <fieldset>

- < label >: Represents a caption for a item in a user interface. Most important to build accessible forms.

- < input >: Creates interactive controls for web based forms to accept data from the user.

- < button >: Interactive element for the user by mouse, keyboard, finger, or voice command.

## Learn JS

Events are reactions from your code coming from actions that happen in the system that you are is programming. "the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box."


2 arguments will you need to provide when using addEventListener():
  
- Name of the event

- A function to handle the event
  
Event Objects are passed automatically to the event handlers and provides extra features and info. Target property within the event object useful because it references to the element the event occurred upon everytime.
  
The difference between event bubbling and event capturing is that event bubbling, the browser checks if the *elements outer-most ancestor(HTML)* for a click event and event capturing th browser checks if the *direct parent*.
