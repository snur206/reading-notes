# [Class 17 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class17notes.md)

This topic matters because it is a guide to Spring and OAuth2.

## Spring Boot and OAuth2

This is a guide on how to build an app with "social login" using spring and Auth02. It goes through the process of creating a new project, adding a home page, securing the app with GitHub and Spring Security, adding a new GitHub app, adding a welcome page, how to make the home page public, adding a logout button, and adding an error page for unauthenticated users with and error message.

## Things I want to know more about

OAuth2 and the difference between that and AuthO, if there is any.
