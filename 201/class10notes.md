# [Class 10 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class10notes.md)

This topic matters because it is discussing errors that can occur and a new term in JS called JS Debugger.

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

Key differences between *Syntax Errors* and *Logic Errors* is that syntax errors are spelling errors in code that causes the program not to run, or stop working part way through and most likely provides a error message, while with logic errors, the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results and there isn't an error message that would point you to the error.

In the previous lab, some errors I seen were indenting and not seeing my footer function. With indenting I just hovered over the error and selected quick fix to indent all of the codes that needed to be indented. With the missing footer I figured out that I misplaced the function and had to place it into the correct spot.

This topic influences my long term goal to be a developer is that errors happen and they're solutions to the errors so my code can work.

## The JavaScript Debugger

JavaScript Debugger is where you watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, it works by identifying the problems that is preventing your code from working/executing like it should.

Breakpoint is where  you want to pause execution.

Call stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
