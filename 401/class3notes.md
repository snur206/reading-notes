# [Class 3 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class3notes.md)

This topic matters because the readings dives into the topics of Primitives vs. Objects, Exceptions in Java, and using a scanner for reading in a file for Java.

This reading discusses the pros and cons of using Java has two-fold type system primitive types. Wrapper classes are immutable where their state can't change once the object is constructed, which makes them final so know one can inherit them. Primitives as a single item, their memory space are smaller than reference types. Yet, when primitives (long and double) take up more memory than the wrapper classes (long and double).
