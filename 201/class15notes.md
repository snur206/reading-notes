# [Class 14 Psychological Safety](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class14notes.md)

This topic matters because the topic reading is about the real life experience of how people interact in group settings. 

Julia Rozovsky did not know what to do with her life. She was once working at a consulting firm and she realized that that was not something she wanted to do anymore. She then became a researcher for two professors at Harvard. She wanted to find a job where she would be a part of a community. So she decided to apply and accepted to Yale University for businiess school of management. While attending the school, she was assined to study a group carefully. Julia did research  on why some work in groups thrive but some do not. She then graduated and was hired by Google and was assigned to Project Aristotle which is a study that hundreds of Google's team where they figure out why exceed and why some struggle, simingly what she did at Yale. 

After reading this article, I believe that I am in the group of people where I excel in working in a group enviroment. An example of that is working in a group final when attending the University of Washington where we had a subject on students overcoming adversity due to your race and/or religious belief. We had to interview fellow students and present our project. While doing that, I believe that I worked much better in a team then working on projects alone, even though I have trust in myself.
