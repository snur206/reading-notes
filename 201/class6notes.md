## JavaScript Object Basics

I would explain an object to a non-technical person saying that it is a collection of data/functions where you start defining and initializing a variable(can be numbers and text like names).

Some advantages to creating object literals is that you can transfer a series of structured or related data items and if you create more than one object literal, your current object "enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create."

Objects differ to arrays because you are using names that are associated with the members value instead of (index) numbers.

var myObj = {

    "State Name"; "Washington",
    
    "My City": "Seattle"
    
  };
  
myObj["State Name"]; Washington

   myObj['My City']; Seattle

***this*** is refering to the current object the code is being written inside. The advantage is that when creating more than one of it, *this* enables you to use the same definiton for all object that you created.
