# [Class 4 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class4notes.md)

This topic matters because the readings dives into Java objects, Classes, and Numbers.

## Java OO Tutorial & Java Classes

Everything is an object, my laptop is an object, my desk is an object. In software, objects are similar to real-world objects. Like real-world objects and Java Objects both have state and behavior. For example, dogs state would be name, color, breed, and hungry, the behavior barking, fetching, wagging tail. In Java, object stores their state in fields, and they are variables in some programming languages and exposes its behavior through methods functions in some programming languages. 

With classes, they're alot of individual objects of the same kind, like bicycles. Bicycles are built with the same blue print. In Java, bicycle is an example of the class object. The class is the blueprint from the individual objects(bicycle) that is created.

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

All digits in a decimal number has a position that let's us know what position is what. Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller. Decimal Number System aka "Base 10", is named that because it is based on the number 10. Writing the numbers 0-10, their will be no symbol to for 10 because 10 is two symbols put together, 1 and 0. It would be different if you do not want to use 10 as your base. For Binary where you would use 2 and Hexadecimal you could use 16 or any number of your choosing with the max of 16. A single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10. They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15. Binary Numbers are are "Base 2" instead of "Base 10", where you start counting at 0, then 1, you would thenrun out of digits so you are at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.    

## Things I want to know more about

Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers especially Hexadecimal.
