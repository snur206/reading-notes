# [Class 11 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class11notes.md)

This topic matters because we are reading about different and new attributes and variables and read about how they work, it is also a review of what we read previously.

## Video and Audio Content

The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s because in the early 2000s the use of plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight were both having security and accessibility issues and now are not used because of the elements <video and audio> as well as the JS APIs are now in control. 


The use of src attribute in the element video is that it contains a path to the video you want to embed.

The use of control attribute in the element video is that include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API.

- srcset: One or more strings that are separated by commas. You are able to specify a list of images
