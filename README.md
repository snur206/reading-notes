## Learning Notes Code 

My name is Sharmarke (he/him). I enjoy **sports**, mainly basketball, football and the UFC. I also enjoy listening to *rap and R&B.*

What ***growth mindset*** means to me is that with effort and your passion, you will be able to learn and gain/develop new skills.

Three reminders keep myself in a growth mindset:

1. Continue to show effort. Understand that it is ok if things are hard and do not avoid anything. Think out-loud and write down ideas/clues to find out the problem.
2. Do not be lazy. Do not hit the snooze button. Get up and Get active. 
3. Ask yourself questions about you. What did you do today? Were you productive or did you procrastinate? So that you can improve internally.
