# [Class 1 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class1notes.md)

This topic matters because it is the introduction to what i can expect in the course and the tech world.

## Questions

### What does “strong typed” mean?

Strong type is a programming language that requires a variable that needs to be defined, as well as the variable it is.

### Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.

Both are programming languages but JavaScript is written in text and needs to be interpreted. Java must be compiled (taking the program that we wrote and converts it into the program the computer can understand).

## Things I want to know more about

Java and how different it is from what I learned in previous courses.
