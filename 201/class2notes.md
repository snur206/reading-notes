# [Class 2 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class2notes.md)

This topic matters because we are continuing to learn about and gain more of an understanding of the three languages that we will learn in this course and most likely moving along in our journey with Code Fellows.

**HTML**

It is important to use semantic elements in our HTML because it will make the browser know how to display text and know what the function is/mean.

In HTML, there six leveling of headings.

The use for < sup > and < sub > elements is to mark up items so they have the correct meaning. i.e  dates and mathematical equations.
  
The title attribute is used to provide full expansion of the term.
  
**CSS**
  
Ways you can apply CSS to HTML are external stylesheet, internal stylesheet and inline styles.
  
You avoid using inline styles because it is the least efficient way to execute CSS where it will be in need of multiple edits in a webpage. Also, it will mix your presentational code with HTML and ccontent, making it to the point of making things hard to read/understand.
  
h2 {} is representing the selector
  
Color: black; and padding: 5px; are CSS declarations because it has a property that is paired with a value.
  
Color and padding are considered properties because you are identifying what features you want to modify.  
 
**JS**  
  
String is a data type sequence of text that is enclosed in single quote marks.  
 
4 types of JS operators:
- Addition  
  
- Assignment  
  
- Strict equality  
  
-Subtraction/Multiplication/Division  
  
Recycling is a real world problem you could solve with a Function because you are reusing or repeating the same code.  
  
 
*Making Decisions In Your Code - Conditionals*  
  
An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
  
Else if is used when you want to chain extra choices or outcomes to if...else.  
  
Three different types of comparison operators:  
  
- === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.

- < and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another.

- <= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.
  
The logical operator && alows you to chain together two or more expressions so that ***ALL*** of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true and || allows ***ONE OR MORE***  
  
 ## Things I want to know more about
  
The logical operators. Really more about Javascript and its operators.
