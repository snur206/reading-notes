This topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module because the readings are going more and more in-depth on HTML and CSS languages learning about new elements (changing color and fonts).

## HTML Media

A real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website would be explaining a story of a situation to people who were not there.
