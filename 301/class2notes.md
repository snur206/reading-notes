# [Class 2 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/301/class2notes.md)

This topic matters because the readings dive into react, props and state.

## React lifecycle

Based on the diagram, Render happens first then componentDidMount.

Mounting is the first thing to happen in the lifecycle.

1st: constructor 2nd: render 3rd: componentDidMount() 4th: react update 5th: componentWillUnmount

componentDidUnmount happens when the page is loading

## React State Vs Props

Object, functions, and arrays are things you can pass in props.

Differences between props and state is that props is used for passing data from parent to child and state is used when you store data.

You re-render application when the components are updated

Some examples of things that we store in state are objects and arrays.


## Things I want to know more about

Would like to know more about props.
