Big O- Vocab: Linearithmic Complexity-  used to describe a growth rate of n by lgn. Complexity that grows with n, but also by lgn. Also, grows faster than input size n.

Linked Lists: Quiz question:

What are the types of Linked List?

A. Current, Next, Previous

B. Singly and Doubly

C. Space and Time

D. All of the above

Whats a Linked List, anyway pt1:  Linked lists are linear data structure. A sequence and a order in which it it constructed, like a game of hopscotch, to get to the end of the list, you will need to go through all of the steps(items) in order. They also can have bytes live in one place and have another byte stored in another memory.

Whats a Linked List, anyway pt2: For linked lists, two types of Big O are O(1) and O(n) functions.  O(1) function is constant time, no matter how many elements they're or how big the input is, O(1) will always same amount of time and memory to run in the algorithm. O(n) function is linear, as the input grows, space and time that runs in the algo grows linearly. O(nÂ²) is to be avoided because it takes up more time and memory as the more elements that you have.
