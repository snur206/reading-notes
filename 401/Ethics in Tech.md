## Ethics in the workplace

In the reading, "The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of", by Bill Sourour, he discusses his story and how you could be asked to do something unethical. It happened to him in 2000 and it is something he will never forget. He was writing code from a young age and was building websites and coded small components for business apps, so he had the passion for coding at a young age. He then got a full time coding job at 21 from a firm founded by a medical doctor and majority of its clients were large pharmaceutical companies.
