# [Class 8 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/201/class8notes.md)

This topic matters because we are diving into CSS and learning new ways to style our page.

## Learn CSS - Flex box

Flex box being one-dimensional content means that you can go and set an alignment in one axis, row, or column but not both together.

The difference between main and cross axis is that the main axis runs horizontally and cross runs the other direction from the main axis (vertically).

Certain properties of flex box negatively impact accessibility because you do not want to affect those who use screen recorders to read out the content and the ones who use keyboards to navigate the logical order.

## CSS Layout - Flex box

Advantages to using flex-box over float:

Change the order of elements on our webpage w/o changing anything in HTML

More responsive and mobile friendly.

This topic connects with my long term goals because I want to be a software developer and learning and reading up on these gives me items and tools to learn so I can be as good as possible.

## Things I want to know more about
