# [Class 32 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class31notes.md)

This topic matters because it is a intro to GraphQL.

## Questions

What makes an API RESTful?

API would need to be stateless and made up of clients, servers, and resources with the requests managed through HTTP method.

What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

A quick setup database for users. An example of that would be that GraphQL schema automatically creates a database table for "Todo" and @model will add an id field as a primary key to the database table automatically. Downside is that caching is more complicated to implement.

Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
