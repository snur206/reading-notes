## HTML Table Basics

Tables should not be used for layouts because it reduces accessibility for users who are visually impaired.

Three different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>:
  
  - <th> </th>: Table header denotes a header. Easier to find data when a header stands out and the design would look better. It defines a cell as header of a group of table cells.
  
  -<tr> </tr>: defines a row of cells in a table
  
  -<thead> </thead>: defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table.
