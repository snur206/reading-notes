This topic matters becauseÂ it is an intro to AWS.

## Questions

What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?

A few alternatives to AWS Amplify, Javascript, React, or Angular for web applications and for mobile, React Native, Android, and iOS platforms are other options. The differences is that it lets developers  add application functionality w/o knowing what AWS services to use to get that functionality. Developers can spend time focusing on their application code then fumbling with infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and scaling considerations. The tradeoffs are that you are not really learning AWS, collaborating with others is frustrating because of deployment collisions, suprising bills when adding  add a functionality, especially for those who use accounts that are not AWS free-tier, and not able to step out of the box due to you being restricted to AWS Amplify.
