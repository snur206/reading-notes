## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = That it will be working on resolving the error/comply with the clients demand.

- 200’s = Code is successful and the request is accepted

- 300’s = The resource the client is requesting is not available at that location

- 400’s = Client error issues where the clients request is invalid like a wrong URL.

- 500’s = Unreachable server request. Server error code.

A status code 202 tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.
