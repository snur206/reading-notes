## [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms.md)

This topic matters because Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental principles in computer science and ties to this course through code challenges and whiteboarding

## Discussion Questions: 

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Using the Big-O notation to add, receive, sort, and search data.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Using the base case condition.

## Things I want to know more about

Learning the Big-O notation.
