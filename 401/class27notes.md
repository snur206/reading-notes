## Questions

What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

It reminded me of Hashmap because they both store key values.

Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

- Lets you know if your method is working

- Identifies bugs before releasing it to the public. Most important because you want your product to be fresh of bugs as much as possible.

- Validation for coders and helps them write more efficient throws, also can seperate them from other coders to employers.

Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
