# [Class 3 Reading Notes](https://github.com/snur206/reading-notes/blob/main/401/class3notes.md)

This topic matters because the readings dives into the topics of Primitives vs. Objects, Exceptions in Java, and using a scanner for reading in a file for Java. 

## Primitives vs. Objects

This reading discusses the pros and cons of using Java has two-fold type system primitive types. Wrapper classes are immutable where their state can't change once the object is constructed, which makes them final so know one can inherit them. Primitives as a single item, their memory space are smaller than reference types. Yet, when primitives (long and double) take up more memory than the wrapper classes (long and double). It is like sharing a room with a younger sibling, when they are small, you take up much of the room, but when they get older, it could go the opposite direction.   

## Exceptions in Java

Exceptions are used in an event to handle a disruption when executing a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. This term is short for "exceptional event". Any valid Java programming language code must honor the Catch or Specify Requirement, where the code can throw certain exceptions and must be closed by a try statement to catch the exception and a method that specifies that it can throw the exception. There are three kind of exceptions, checked exception, error, and runtime exception. You need to have some code to throw and exception before you catch it. Any code can do it. All methods use throw statements to throw an exception. I have used a try and catch in my code before for 301.   

## Using Scanner to read in a file in Java

Scanner is useful to take an input and breaks it down into tokens. They use white space to separate the tokens. It also supports tokens for all of the Java language's primitive types except for char.
