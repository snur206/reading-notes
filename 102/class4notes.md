**Wireframe?**
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers, where it allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the already performed by the UX design team. When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code.
Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
**Wireframing examples**
People like to draw their wireframes by hand
Others feel more comfortable using software like Invision or Balsamiq.
Wireframes are drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change.
With paper-prototypes,you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Cheaper and easier when changes are at this stage.
Switching later to software allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.
Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:
* Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
* Sketch > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Coded
**Best tools for wireframing**
UXPin, InVision and Wireframe.cc
Ux design is a process, *wireframing* isn’t the first step in this process.
Before you pick up a pen and paper, you understand who your audience is by way of user research. 
Your *wireframing* is going to get very messy if you do not have an idea of how many screens you will need to produce and the flow you expect the user to follow.
**Wireframs into prototypes**
Tools
- Proto.io
- Adobe XD
- Framer
- Sketch
- Sigma
**HTML**
*Hypertext Markup Language*
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
Has a specific syntax
HTML can link from one webpage to another
Basic building block for web pages as we know it!
HTML: structure of your page
<html></html>
**Semantics**
refers to the meaning of a piece of code
*JavaScript*
consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li>
*CSS*
consider styling a list with li
*HTML*
<h1>

Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
Roughly 100 semantic elements are available.
